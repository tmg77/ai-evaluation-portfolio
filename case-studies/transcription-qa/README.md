## Content Type
Conversational audio with overlapping speech, interruptions, and
variable pacing.

## QA Checks Performed
- Verbatim vs. clean-read alignment with project specifications
- Speaker identification consistency
- Timestamp accuracy and caption timing drift
- Readability (line length, segmentation, punctuation)
- Non-speech indicators (music, laughter, pauses)

## Error Types & Severity
- **Critical:** Meaning altered, missing negation, incorrect speaker attribution
- **Major:** Timing drift impacting comprehension, omitted full phrases
- **Minor:** Style, punctuation, and formatting inconsistencies

## Evaluation Outcome
The transcript requires revision due to multiple major timing issues
and one critical speaker attribution error.
