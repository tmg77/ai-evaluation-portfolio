email after an initial meeting.

by the user.

## Response B (Summary)
Clear, structured, and directly addresses the user’s request by
including next steps, timelines, and a concise call-to-action.

## Preferred Response
**Response B**

## Justification
Response B demonstrates stronger instruction adherence and usefulness.
While both responses are grammatically correct and professional in tone,

next steps and clearer structure.
